## Description

*AMCL - Apache Milagro Crypto Library*

AMCL is a standards compliant C cryptographic library with no external dependencies.

AMCL is provided in *C* language but includes a *[Python](https://www.python.org)* wrapper for some modules to aid development work.

NOTE: This product includes software developed at *[The Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/)*.

## Software Dependencies

In order to build this library, the following packages are required:

* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) is required to build the source code.
* [CFFI](https://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.8/), the C Foreign Function Interface for Python is required in order to execute tests.
* [Doxygen](http://doxygen.org) is required to build the source code documentation.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) language is required to build the Python language wrapper.

The above packages can be installed in different ways, depending on the Operating System used:

* **Ubuntu 18.04 Linux**

## Build Instructions

#### Linux and Mac

##### Quick start

Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-milagro-crypto-c.git
cd incubator-milagro-crypto-c
```

Edit and run this script

```
./scripts/build.sh
```

or use the docker build

```
./scripts/docker.sh -h
```

##### Multiple curves and RSA security levels

The default build (see config.mk) uses multiple curves and RSA security
levels. There is an example called testall.c in the examples directory that
shows how to write a program to use the different curves etc in a single
program. To build and run the example use this script;

```
./scripts/buildMulti.sh
```

##### Manual build

NOTE: The default build is for 64 bit machines.  Either use Git to clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-milagro-crypto-c.git
cd incubator-milagro-crypto-c
```
Or, if using an official Apache release, download the compressed archive, extract it and navigate into its root directory.
```
mkdir -p target/build
cd target/build
cmake ../..
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:./
make
make test
make doc
sudo make install
```

NOTE: When running the ASan tests, make sure to export the following variable:

```
export ASAN_OPTIONS=verify_asan_link_order=0
```

On Debian/Ubuntu machine instead of executing the *"sudo make install"* command it is possible to execute *"sudo checkinstall"* to build and install a DEB package.

Now you can set the path to where libs and python package are installed:

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:./:/opt/amcl/lib
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
```

NOTE: The build can be configured by setting flags on the command line, for example:

```
cmake -DAMCL_CHUNK=64 ../..
cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/amcl -D AMCL_CHUNK=64 -D BUILD_WCC=on ../..
```

It is possible also to build the library supporting more than one elliptic curve and more  than one RSA security level, for example

```
cmake -DAMCL_CURVE=BN254CX,NIST254 -DAMCL_RSA=2048,3072 ../..
```

To list other available CMake options, use:

```
cmake -LH
```

##### Uninstall software

```
sudo make uninstall
```

##### Building an installer

After having built the libraries you can build a binary installer and a source distribution by running this command

```
sudo make package
```

#### Windows

Start a command prompt as an administrator and either use Git to clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-milagro-crypto-c.git
cd incubator-milagro-crypto-c
```
Or, if using an official Apache release, download the compressed archive, extract it and navigate into its root directory.
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -D WORD_SIZE=64 ..
mingw32-make
mingw32-make test
mingw32-make doc
mingw32-make install
```

Post install append the PATH system variable to point to the install ./lib:

*Control Panel - System and Security - System - Advanced System Settings - Environment Variables*

The build can be configured using by setting flags on the command line i.e.

```
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -D WORD_SIZE=64  -D BUILD_PYTHON=on ..
```

##### Uninstall software

```
mingw32-make uninstall
```

##### Building an installer

After having built the libraries you can build a Windows installer using this command

```
mingw32-make package
```

In order for this to work [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io) has to have been installed

## Contributions

This project includes a Makefile that allows you to test and build the project in a Linux-compatible system with simple commands.
All the artifacts and reports produced using this Makefile are stored in the *target* folder.

All the packages listed in the *Dockerfile* are required in order to build and test all the library options in the current environment. Alternatively, everything can be built inside a [Docker](https://www.docker.com) container using the command "make -f Makefile.docker buildall".

To see all available options:

```
make help
```

To build the builder Docker image:

```
make -f Makefile.docker
```

To build the project inside a Docker container (requires Docker) you need to build a builder image (once), and then build the project in its context:

```
make -f Makefile.docker buildall
```

To build a particular set of predefined makefile options inside a Docker container:

```
make -f Makefile.docker build TYPE=LINUX_64BIT_NIST256_RSA2048
```

or in the current environment:

```
make build TYPE=LINUX_64BIT_NIST256_RSA2048
```

To execute all the test builds and generate reports in the current environment:
```
make qa
```

To format the code (please use this command before submitting any pull request):
```
make format
```

## Crypto Notice

This distribution includes cryptographic software. The country in which you
currently reside may have restrictions on the import, possession, use, and/or
re-export to another country, of encryption software. BEFORE using any
encryption software, please check your country's laws, regulations and
policies concerning the import, possession, or use, and re-export of encryption
software, to see if this is permitted. See <http://www.wassenaar.org/> for
more information.

The Apache Software Foundation has classified this software as Export Commodity
Control Number (ECCN) 5D002, which includes information security software using
or performing cryptographic functions with asymmetric algorithms. The form and
manner of this Apache Software Foundation distribution makes it eligible for
export under the "publicly available" Section 742.15(b) exemption (see the BIS
Export Administration Regulations, Section 742.15(b)) for both object code and
source code.


## Disclaimer

Apache Milagro is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
